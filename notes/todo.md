# about
Grocery Bliss is a grocery list app that tracks both the items on your grocery list as well as the quantity of things you have at home. Seeing what you have at home not only aids you in creating your grocery list but also helps you create meals out of whatever you have in stock so you are a more efficient shopper. Less food goes to waste and you're less likely to end up hungry because you don't have what you need for a complete meal. 

created with SolidJS and uses IndexedDB
